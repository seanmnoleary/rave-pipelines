Description: 
    Abstract: Intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) provides a unique 
    opportunity to measure human brain function with implanted electrodes. 
    We describe the YAEL (Your Advanced Electrode Localization) software package 
    for accurately determining electrode locations, a key step in neuroscience 
    inference. Existing workflows require manually selecting each electrode 
    from the patient's computed tomography (CT) scan, a time consuming and 
    error-prone process. YAEL expedites this process with automated electrode 
    localization. In modern clinical practice, iEEG patients are implanted with 
    stereotactic (sEEG) electrode shafts, each containing many contacts. YAEL 
    users may click on only two contacts on a given shaft and YAEL will 
    automatically select all remaining contacts, accounting for any bends in 
    the shaft introduced during the surgical insertion process. 
    After identifying the approximate location of each electrode, YAEL applies 
    a refinement process. Electrode locations are automatically adjusted using 
    nearby CT densities. While some workflows downsample the CT to match the 
    resolution of the pre-surgical MRI, YAEL uses the original CT for more 
    accurate localization. This is important for identifying the location of 
    the electrode relative to cortical lamina or small subcortical structures.
    A common source of error is the confusion of contacts on nearby sEEG shafts. 
    To ensure that electrodes are mapped correctly, YAEL provides simultaneous 
    viewing of 3D cortical surface models and 2D MRI slices, together with all 
    electrode positions. Both penetrating sEEG electrodes and grids and strips 
    of surface electrocorticographic (ECoG) electrodes are supported, along
    with the brain shift compensation sometimes required for accurate ECoG 
    localization. Viewer parameters, such as CT threshold, can be adjusted 
    on-the-fly for quick troubleshooting.
