Description: 
    Users may choose 'BIDS' project and subject, import all sessions or 
    choose certain sessions into 'RAVE'. To simplify the paths (e.g. Windows
    only allows 260 characters), 'RAVE' will remove the 'BIDS' indicators
    such as 'sub-', 'ses-' in the imported subject folder names and block
    folders. Note this module converts into 'RAVE' raw format, please run
    'import_lfp_native' module afterwards. This module is part of 
    'RAVE preprocessing pipeline' and can run offline as a pipeline instance;
    see 'raveio::pipeline("import_bids")'.
