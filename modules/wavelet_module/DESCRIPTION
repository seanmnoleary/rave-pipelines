Description: 
    Use 'Morlet' Wavelets to decompose 'iEEG' signals. Users can choose 
    equally spaced frequencies from 1Hz to 'Nyquist' and set the number of
    wavelet cycles. The module provides optional choices to down-sample signals 
    before and after wavelet. Please run 'Notch' filter module prior to wavelet.
    This module can run either before or after the reference.
    This module is part of 'RAVE preprocessing pipeline' and can run offline as 
    a pipeline instance; see 'raveio::pipeline("wavelet_module")'.
